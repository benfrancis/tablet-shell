# Webian Tablet Shell

[Webian Tablet Shell](http://webian.org/shell) is a graphical shell for the web (tablet version).

## Getting Started

Tablet Shell is designed to run as the system app on a touchscreen Android Things device.

When running on a device the intention is that the system chrome will be loaded inside a WebView/GeckoView.

For desktop development you can run and debug the system chrome using the experimental Quantum Browser Runtime (qbrt) from Mozilla.

To get started hacking on the Tablet Shell chrome, first make sure that you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [qbrt](https://mykzilla.org/2017/03/15/introducing-qbrt) installed, then simply clone the repository from GitHub and execute the system chrome using qbrt.

```
$ npm install -g qbrt
$ git clone https://github.com/webianproject/tablet-shell.git
$ cd tablet-shell/chrome
$ qbrt run ./
```

This will launch Webian Tablet Shell in a new window and also open developer tools.
